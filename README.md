The above image shows the gross rent is rapidly increasing where as sale price per square foot is only slightly increasing.  This drastic change puts a tremendous amount of pressure on renters to make sure they're able to pay rent.

This is further demonstrated in the below chart that compares the number of housing units built over the years, demonstrating that in a very short amount of time, several locations in San Franciso have expanded the number of units at an incredibly rapid rate.

Here is a look at the different locations that demonstrate the wide range of growth.

If you were a residental, chances are you'd find space to live close the highways, but this would mean a constant hum of traffic in the back ground.  For commercial, the most common areas would be close to the waterfront, but the trade off is location is key.  If you choose a commercial spot with not as much foot traffic, it can be very difficult to pay the rent to use the space.
